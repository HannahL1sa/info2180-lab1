 <h2>Hannah-Lisa Whittle</h2>
 <p>I am a computer science major at the University of the West Indies. I am 19 years old and I am from Kingston, Jamaica. Drawing, singing, and reading are three of my favorite activities. In the future, I hope to work as a programmer or software developer. I am interested in web development because I have always wanted to make my own websites. I am also a very creative person, and I believe that web development will allow me to express my creativity and employ aesthetic sensibilities to create great websites that others would find useful.</p>
